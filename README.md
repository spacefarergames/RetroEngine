# RetroEngine
A custom version of DuckStation that allows replacement of FMVs (STRS) with external MP4s and additional custom improvements that make remastering retro games on PSX easy

We won't upload the entire DuckStation code as it's not needed, just these files are provided for DuckStation contrib for (maybe) upstream allowing easy replacements of STR videos in the future.
